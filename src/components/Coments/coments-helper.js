It was excellent
I took a package of 3 activities: Dinner in Pocople, Night Bus Tour and Moulin Rouge. I was a bit concerned by the bad reviews I read here and the cheap price of the package, but I have to say everything was good. We didn’t have any problem at all and we enjoyed a great offer, for the money of 1 activity we did 3! Super recommended.`, name:'Robert Doeng', ocupation:'/sport journalist', image:male2},{id:'3', rating:5, country:'Italy', comment:`We were in Venice, Florence and Rome. Each of had been many times before. So the new cities were the most impressive. Lucca and Ostia Antica and Montepulciano. Andrea and one of the guides recommended an excellent restaurant in Lucca, *** in the basement of a castle. The food and atmosphere unexpected. Also in Lucca we managed to get tickets for a Puccini concert which was magnificent.`, name:'Susan Jared', ocupation:'/doctor', image:female2}]
